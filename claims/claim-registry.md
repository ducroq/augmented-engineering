## Priority Guide

### P0 (Critical) — thesis fails without these

| ID | Claim | Risk if Wrong |
|----|-------|---------------|
| T-1 | Structured feedback loops improve agent output quality in engineering | Core thesis collapses — loops might add overhead without benefit |
| T-2 | Multi-agent review produces better results than single-agent | Could be that one good agent + good prompt is sufficient |
| T-3 | Human-in-the-loop oversight remains necessary (agents can't fully self-validate) | If agents can self-validate, the engineer's role claim is wrong |
| V-1 | Agentic feedback loops apply across V-model phases (not just software) | Could be limited to certain phases; V-model mapping overpromises |
| V-2 | The generate→review→validate→oversee pattern transfers from software to other engineering | Could be software-specific; other engineering domains may need different patterns |

### P1 (Important) — target 90%

| ID | Claim | Risk if Wrong |
|----|-------|---------------|
| C-1 | Domain expertise is required for effective human oversight of agents | Could be that general AI literacy suffices |
| C-2 | Validation capability (not tool proficiency) is the critical competency | Could be that tool skill matters more than judgment |
| C-3 | These competencies transfer across AI tools (tool-agnostic) | Could be that each tool requires tool-specific competencies |
| E-1 | Equation-checking agents catch errors that standard LLM review misses | Could be a fluke or limited to simple arithmetic |
| E-2 | Multi-agent requirements review achieves comparable quality to human review | Could be that agreement metrics mask systematic blind spots |
| E-3 | AI-augmented design review covers disciplines a single engineer would miss | Could be that checklists are shallow and miss real issues |
| S-1 | Software engineering's feedback loop patterns are transferring into other engineering domains | Could be aspirational rather than observed |
| S-2 | This transfer is happening now (2025-2026), not hypothetically | Could be premature — real adoption may be years away |

### P2 (Supporting) — target 70%

| ID | Claim | Risk if Wrong |
|----|-------|---------------|
| B-1 | 90% of engineering teams now use AI tools | Minor — general adoption context |
| B-2 | Current approaches treat agents as isolated tools, not feedback loops | Minor — framing claim |
| B-3 | The agentic pattern originated in software development (CI/CD, code review) | Minor — historical context |
| B-4 | Agent-ready project structure improves multi-session agent effectiveness | Minor — methodology claim |

### Core Thesis

| ID | Statement | Type | Priority | Confidence | Source | Source Tier | Status |
|----|-----------|------|----------|------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| T-1 | Structured feedback loops (generate→review→validate→oversee) improve the quality and reliability of agent-generated engineering outputs | PROPOSITION | P0 | EMERGING | OWN WORK: case studies (OPAL, driven-pendulum, vmodel.eu); driven-pendulum 2026-03-16: 6-agent parallel review found 14 issues that single-pass work missed | E | [ ] |
| T-2 | Multi-agent architectures (separate generate/review/validate agents) produce better results than single-agent approaches | CLAIM | P0 | EMERGING | OWN WORK: vmodel.eu (multi-agent vs single-agent comparison); driven-pendulum (equation-checker vs standard review); driven-pendulum 2026-03-16: 6 specialized agents in parallel found 14 cross-cutting issues | E | [ ] |
| T-3 | Human-in-the-loop oversight remains necessary — agents cannot fully self-validate engineering outputs | ARGUMENT | P0 | SUPPORTED | OWN WORK: case studies show agents miss domain-specific issues; aligned with validation competency research (Digital Engineers) | E+F | [~] |

**T-3 warrant:** Engineering outputs have safety, regulatory, and physics constraints that require domain judgment to evaluate. Case studies show agents generating plausible-but-incorrect outputs that pass agent-level review but fail human inspection.

### V-Model Coverage

| ID | Statement | Type | Priority | Confidence | Source | Source Tier | Status |
|----|-----------|------|----------|------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| V-1 | Agentic feedback loops have been demonstrated across at least 5 of 6 V-model phases (requirements, architecture, design, implementation, testing) | CLAIM | P0 | EMERGING | OWN WORK: case studies cover these phases | E | [~] |
| V-2 | The generate→review→validate→oversee pattern, originating in software engineering, transfers to mechanical, electrical, and systems engineering | PROPOSITION | P0 | SPECULATIVE | OWN WORK: OPAL (electrical/optical), driven-pendulum (mechanical/physics) — limited sample | E | [ ] |

### Competency Claims

| ID | Statement | Type | Priority | Confidence | Source | Source Tier | Status |
|----|-----------|------|----------|------------|--------|-------------|--------|

| C-2 | Validation capability (critical assessment of AI outputs) matters more than tool proficiency for effective augmented engineering | ARGUMENT | P1 | SUPPORTED | Digital Engineers research (proposition P1: Validation Primacy); vmodel.eu (scoring quality depends on understanding requirements, not LLM operation); driven-pendulum 2026-03-16: physics V&V passed but domain expert caught naming error | E | [~] |
| C-3 | Engineering competencies for working with AI agents transfer across specific AI tools | ARGUMENT | P1 | EMERGING | Digital Engineers research (Tool Agnosticism Principle); limited direct evidence from case studies | E+F | [ ] |
